                      <p class="mb-30">Asked to describe the creative process, the painter Jasper
Johns replied, “It’s simple: You just take something and do
something to it, and then do something else to it. Keep
doing this, and pretty soon you’ve got something.”
Johns’ comment succinctly summarizes everything
I have learned about creativity in 60+ years of draw-
ing. Having said that, we will use the rest of this book to
explore what it means to “take something and do some-
thing to it.” In the process, I hope to deepen your experi-
ence of imagining and creating.
Keys to Drawing With Imagination takes a broad look at
what it means to draw from your imagination. This might
mean drawing the fantasy images in your head. It could
also mean distorting, abstracting or simply doodling.
Imaginative drawing may include making strange com-
binations, making connections between seemingly unre-
lated things or simply drawing from memory. It certainly
involves making creative choices about the things you
choose to draw.
We tend to think of imagination and creativity as quali-
ties that people have. But in reality these qualities show
up only in action—as something you do. Simply put,
imagining is what you do in your head; creating is what
you do on paper. Are there rules for creating? Probably
not, if a rule is something that you must do. But let’s dis-
tinguish between rules and principles. I believe that there
are useful principles that can help you create. Jasper Johns
has already given us a first principle: Creativity occurs in
action.
You don’t need to be exceptionally clever to draw
creatively. Certainly theories about creativity don’t help
much. You don’t even need to have particularly good
ideas. Often, ideas don’t occur to you until after you’ve
started drawing. So you should not wait around for great
ideas. Just begin with simple ideas. Bigger things will
emerge out of them. We can make this our second principle: Creativity begins with simple ideas.<br>
                        <br> 
                      <p class="mb-30"> The one indispensable quality essential for creating is
engagement with the work. When you are engaged—lost
in the work—you shift out of the future and into the pres-
ent. This is where creativity thrives. Out of this comes our
third principle: Creativity lives in the present.
A common experience for both artists and students is
to be disappointed in the gap between what we imagine
and how it actually appears on paper. Our skills rarely
seem up to the products of our minds. This is simply the
way it is—and it is true for almost everyone. There are two
things you can do about it. First, draw a lot—a whole lot.
All mastery comes through practice. (My previous book,
Keys to Drawing, may also be helpful. It focuses on devel-
oping basic drawing skills.) This gives us our fourth prin-
ciple: Creativity increases with practice.
The other thing that you can do is confine your judg-
ments to the practical and specific: to such things as shad-
ing, proportions, pattern and so on. General self-criticism
isn’t helpful. Avoid subtly self-disparaging statements
such as:
“You’re either creative or you’re not.”
“Some people just have it. Others don’t.”
“I don’t have any ideas.”
“I have lots of ideas, but I don’t draw well enough to
express them.”
This leads us to yet another principle: Creativity
increases as judgment and criticism decrease.</p>
